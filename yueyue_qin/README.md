#Add a gulpfile and a package.json to your greet assignment DUE: Jan 6, 2016 by 1pm(class start)

##Description:
For this assignment you will add a gulpfile and a package.json file to your previous assignment.

The package.json file should include all the dependencies and dev devpendencies for the project.

The gulpfile should contain a task to run the mocha/chai test as well as run jshint on all of your code. This should include your tests and your gulpfile.

Create a second pull request to the simple_modular_and_test_patterns repo, this PR should contain just the code relevant to this assignment(only your package.json/gulpfile) submit a link to that pull request.

##Bonus:
For an extra point, set up a watch task that reruns your tests/jshint on changes to any of your files (minus package.json)

For another bonus point move the eslint options out of your eslint rc and into gulp
